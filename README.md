This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Description of the project

This project represents myself as a specialist and gives an overview to HR employee about me. This showcase portfolio contains a short description of myself as a personality, recent work I have done at university both in groups and alone and a contact form for me to get back to you if you want to talk to me. By clicking on one of the projects you will be redirected to a new page containing all needed details and examples about that certain project you need.

## Project goals

The main goal of this project is to introduce myself, my work and my skills to the company I would like to work for or doing an internship.
Second goal is more personal - to learn Nextjs and its basics as this showcase portfolio is my first project made in Nextjs.

## Technologies used

I created a Nextjs project via Visual Studio code and mainly worked in HTML and CSS and used JavaScript when needed for some animations.
Also for "Start your project" form I used the "EmailJs" platform where I am able to get the answers on my personal email whenever someone completes the form. I made a template of emails I will receive from the form to my email with no backend and API's. For more information check the platform I used: (https://www.emailjs.com/)

## Iterations and validation moments 

In the beginning I researched a lot to have an idea how my portfolio is going to look like, I chose 2 portfolios online I liked the most and combined them by using certain design and structure decisions from those portfolios plus adding my own style and made it in my own way. I looked what all portfolios have in common so I also add it to my portfolio and test it. I tested my product on all stages: while prototyping in figma and made some changes and while coding. After testing in all stages I made a lot of changes like changing the header gradient, adding and structuring the information regarding my projects, changed some animations for a better UI/UX perspective etc... For more detailed informarion about the process with visual examples visit my portflow from canvas - second Review.
